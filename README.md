Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintainance of high quality software systems. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects  of modern life. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
They include the development of programming languages, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. 2.Design-creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface. 3.Implementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. 4.Testing- conducting various texts to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. 5. Deployment - realising the software to users and customers. 6 Maintainance- providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves sequencial approach with distinct phases for example requirements, design and implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall while agile methodology involves interactive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change common examples are Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), Feature Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Adaptive Software Development (ASD), Crystal, and Lean Software Development (LSD).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
A Quality Assuarance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A Project Manager oversees the planning, executing and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code ,they include visual studio and Eclipse
VCS track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges include changing environments, tight deadlines and technical debt. Strategies include effective communication, agile  methodologies priotization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing - testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing  - testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it  meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
